NLTK:
>> Natural Language ToolKit
>> It is a python library used for working with NLP tasks.

Who created NLTK?
>> By steven bird and edward loper

What can NLTK do?
>> NLTK provided tools for:
   >> Tokenization (splitting text into words)
   >> Stopword removal (removing common words that do not add important meaning to a sentence. Ex:is, am, are, the, as, with, an, etc,..  
   >> Stemming (process of reducing a word to its root(base) from. Ex: like removing ing, ed, ly, s those suffixes (flying to fly))
   >> Lemmatization (reduces words to their meaningful root form using vocabulary and grammar rules. Ex: "better" becomes good, "studies" becomes study)
   >> Difference between Stemming and Lemmatization is:
      >> | Feature          | Stemming   | Lemmatization |
      >> | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
      >> | Cuts words       | Yes        | No            |
      >> | Uses grammar     | No         | Yes           |
      >> | Output real word | Not always | Yes           |
      >> | Accuracy         | Medium     | High          |
      Example: studies --> studi (Stemming - not follows any dictionary rules, grammer)
               studies --> study (Lemmatization - it follows all the rules in english)

Installation :

1. Natural Language understanding:
>> this Classification understanding the meaning of text.
   >> intent (user’s goal or purpose behind a sentence.)
   >> sentiment 
   >> entities (Key information extracted from text)
   >> context (background or previous information that helps understand the current sentence correctly.)
>> Examples:
   >> Sentiment Analysis (positive/negative review)
   >> Chatbots understanding user queries
   >> Spam detection
   >> Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Real Example:
input : "Book a flight to hyderabad tommorow"
system understands: 
>> intent: book flight
>> location:hyderabad
>> date:tommorow 

2. Natural Language Generation(NLG):
>> Generating human like text 
The system creates,
>> sentenses, summarizes, stories, answers, etc,.
>> Examples:
   >> Chatgpt responses
   >> Automatic emails replies
   >> News article Generation
   >> report Generation

3. Speech Processing:
>> Working with Voice
>> includes, speech to text(Google assistent), Text to speech(like Alexa speaking).

4. Rule based NLP:
>> uses grammer rules
>> uses dictionaries
>> no learning 
>> old method
>> Example :
   >> it text contains "not good" --> "negative"

5. Statistical NLP:
>> Uses probability
>> Uses Machine learning
>> More flexible than rule based

6. Deep learning based NLP:
>> Uses Neural networks 
>> Uses Transformers
>> Examples: BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers),
             GPT(Generative Pre-trained Transformer),
             LLaMA(Large Language Model Meta AI), etc,..

fit() vs transform() vs fit_transform():

1. fit(): Learn from data
>> in CountVectorizar, fit()
>> Reads all documents 
>> Builds vocabulary
>> Assigns index numbers to words
>> But it only learns vocabulary not convert text to numbers yet.
>> vectorizer = CountVectorizar()
>> vectorizer.fit(documents)

2. transfrom(): uses learned vocabulary to convert text to numbers 
>> counts words frequency 
>> creates the numerical matrix
>> But it deosnt work alone unless fit() was called before
>> vectorizer = CountVectorizar()
>> vectorizer.fit(documents)
>> vectorizer.transform(documents)

3. fit_transform(): It does BOTH steps in one line.
>> X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
Internally it does:

fit()
then
transform()

So:

Learn vocabulary
Convert text to matrix

How Nltk CountVectorizar assigns a numerical value?
>> Each value = Number of times that word appears in that document

Example:
documents =["I Love Java",
            "I Love Python"]

Step1: Converting all text to lowercase
>> "i love java"
>> "i love python"

step2: Tokenization(split into words)
doc1 = ["i","love","jave"]
doc2 = ["i","love","python"]

step3: Remove single charecters by default charecter 
Beacuse default pattern is r'(?u)\b\w\w+\b' which means words must have atleast 2 letters.
so now doc is 
doc1 = ["love","java"] "i" removed  
doc2 = ["love","python"] "i" removed 

step4: create vocabulary (sorted alphabetically)
so unique words only so,
java
Love
python 
>> by default alphabetical order
and then do index mapping like this:
>> java --> 0
>> love --> 1
>> python --> 2

step4: count frequency in each document
>> now algorithm in CountVectorizar counts how many times each word appears.

>> doc1 = "java love"
so,
>> java --> 1
>> love --> 1
>> python --> 0 
>> so this text to vector looks like this [1,1,0]

>> doc1 = "love python"
so,
>> java --> 0
>> love --> 1
>> python --> 1
>> so this text to vector looks like this [0,1,1]

Sentiment analysis is a classification of finding a text which is actually a positive sentense or negative text 
>> Used in social media platforms to analysis trend analysis using comments 

Example:
"I love this phone" → Positive
"This movie is terrible" → Negative

Now we need to build a mini project on sentiment anaysis at first we need to install sklearn and some required libraries that kept on project file.

>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
>> It splits your dataset into:
>> Training Data -> used to train model
>> Testing Data -> used to test model 

# why split?
>> If we take same data for both testing and training then 
>> Model will memorize
>> Accuracy will be fake

Example:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

80% → Training
20% → Testing

2. from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
>> This imports the Multinomial Naive Bayes model. 
>> It is a classification algorithm used for text classification,spam detection, sentiment analysis 
>> It works well with bag of words and  word frequencies
>> Why Multinomial?
>> Beacuse it works on count based features
Example:
love = 3
java = 1
>> Perfect for CountVectorizer output.

3. from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
>> This imports a function to measure model performance.
>> it calculates accuracy of a model using the below formula
>> accuracy = correct predictions / total predictions
>> accuracy range between 0.0 to 0.1(0% to 100%)
>> If 90 out of 100 predictions are correct:
>> then accuracy of the model is 90% and also the predicted output is 90% have chances to correct.
